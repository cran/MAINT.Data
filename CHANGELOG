########## Version 1.1.2 (June 2017) ###################

Version 1.1.2 updates and improves the documentation of MAINT.Data,
and corrects a previously unnoticed bug on the C code of function fullte. 


########## Versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 (June 2017) ###################

The following changes were made in versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 of R package MAINT.Data:


1)  The routines for robust estimation and outlier detection were improved and
    made more flexible. In particular, Version 1.1.o implements a novel enhanced
    method for finding bias correction factors for the re-weighted MCD estimator,
    and adds the function getIdtOutl, that tries to indentify outliers comparing
    robust Mahalanobis distances with quantiles either from asymptotic chi-square 
    distribtuions, or from F and Beta approximations that, according to the literature
    may work better in finite samples.   

2)  The methods rownames and colnames were added to the class IData, and methods
    var, cor (returning respectivelly matrices of variance-covariance and correlation
    estimates) were added to all classes derived from the class IdtE.

########## Versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 (October 2016) ###################

This is a major upgrade of the package with several new features and improvements of
the existing code. The two main extensions of version 1.0.0 are:

1)  The implementation of methods for estimation, testing and discriminant analysis based on the Skew-Normal
    distribution. For details see the documentation of the mle, MANOVA and snda methods and the IDtSNDE, IDtNandSNDE,
    IDtSngSNDE, IDtSngNandSNDE, IDtMxSNDE, IDtMxNandSNDE, IdtSNlocda, IdtLocSNMANOVA, IdtLocNSNMANOVA, 
    IdtGenSNMANOVA and IdtGenNSNMANOVA classes.

2)  The implementation of methods for the robust estimation of parameters of the guassian distribution, as well
    as the corresponding methods for robust linear and quadratic discriminant analysis. For details see the 
    documentation of fasttle, fulltle, Roblda and Robqda methods and the IDtSngNDRE and IDtMxNRDE classes.  

Furthermore, among other new features, version 1.0.0 also includes specializations of the generic vcov method
(returning estimates of the variance-covariance matrices for the parameter estimators used) for almost all 
(all except those based on robust methods) classes derived from IdtE, i.e. the classes containing results 
of model estimation.  


########## Versions 0.5 and 0.5.1 (October 2015) ###################

The following changes were made in Versions 0.5 and 0.5.1 of R package MAINT.Data:

1)  Several functions from the default package ""stats"" were imported 
    into the MAINT.Data namespace to ensure that they did not become undefined globals. 

2)  The strict dependecy on packages MASS and miscTools was restored by an Imports directive
    in the DESCRIPTION file (ensuring that these packages are always attached when installed)


##########  Version 0.4  (May 2015) #################

The strict dependecy on packages MASS and miscTools was replaced by a Suggests directive


##########  Version 0.3  (October 2014) #################

The following changes were made in Version 0.3 of R package MAINT.Data:

1) In the DESCRIPTION file the Depends directive for imported packages was repalced by an Imports directive

2) Lines with more 100 characters in the documentation files were split into two

3) The longer examples in the documentation files were replace by faster examples   


##########  Version 0.2  (October 2011) #################

The following changes were made in Version 0.2 of R package MAINT.Data:

1) The deprecated direct use of sd for data.frames was replaced by sapply(object,sd).

2) The original functions head, tail, coef, predict, stdEr, lda and qda
   were imported in order to properly recognizing them in the definition
   of methods for MAINT.Data classes.

3) the S3 method print for class summaryIData, and the S3 methods "[", "[<-" "=="
   and "!=" for class IData, were registered.

4) The function is.IData was replaced by is(object,"IData")
